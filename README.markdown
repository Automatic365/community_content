## Overview

Each six-week session, all students in module 2 will prepare a lightning talk based on the topics below. All students in modules 3 and 4 will work in groups to prepare a lightning talk about their job shadowing experience. Preparation and completion of any of these options will take approximately 2-4 hours.

## Schedule

* Module 2 students - Friday, July 15 (Week 3) at 1:15 PM
* Module 3 and 4 students - Friday, July 22 (Week 4) at 1:15 PM

## Community Content How-To

Choose a topic (ie - Animation with Snap.js). Topics cannot be repeated during the module and are first come, first serve. During the week of your lightning talk, the schedule is as follows: 

* **Monday**: Submit your topic to the [markdown file](module-06-26-16.markdown) **before 4pm**. 
* **Tuesday**: Add your outline as a gist **before 4pm**.
* **Wednesday**: Draft slides and/or content. If you'd like feedback, send your draft to Casey or Beth.
* **Thursday**: Rehearsal after wrap up. Your slides and/or content should be prepared in advance as laptops will be closed during rehearsal. Attendance is mandatory. 
* **Friday**: Present your 5-minute talk or student-led session for your Turing peers.

## Topics & Themes

All topics must be approved 

**Module 2 students**: It is preferred that your topic fit into one of the themes below. That said, feel free to pitch a topic related to your experience prior to Turing. Keep in mind that the topic should be of interest to a school of software developers and that the topic must be approved before moving forward.

* Computer Hardware
* Computer Science
* Design / User Experience
* DevOps
* Front End Development
* General Software Methodologies / Techniques
* Historical or Present-day People in Computer Science
* JavaScript Architecture / Libraries
* Programming & Science
* Programming & the Arts
* Programming Languages
* Ruby Architecture / Libraries
* Software Libraries
* Software Testing
* Technology & Law
* Technology & Society
* Technology & Ethics
* Web Technologies

**Module 3 and 4 students**: Your topic will be your job shadowing experience.

When considering the content of your presentation, take care to promote a welcoming environment for all students regardless of their age, gender, socio-economic background, religious beliefs, or sexual orientation. 

## Picking a Topic

* You don't need to be an expert on a topic. You can do the research and become expert enough to deliver a valuable talk.
* A talk needs to teach something of value to the audience.
* A talk needs to be at an appropriate level for the audience, not too basic and not too advanced.
* A talk needs to have a *message*, not just a subject. "Introduction to RSpec" is boring, "Why You Should Use RSpec" has a message.
